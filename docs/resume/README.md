## About Me

I attended [Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogwarts) to study witchcraft, supervised by **Dumbledore** and other professors. 

I'm trying my best to battle with Lord Voldemort, the evil Wizard that we all fear. My research area includes Defence Against the Dark Arts and other magic. :dizzy:

  **The Making of Harry Potter's Wand**

  Harry P., Hermione G., *et al*

  Harry's wand was broken in 1997, but was repaired by him after the 1998 Battle of Hogwarts. Usually the repair of a wand is impossible, but with the use of the Elder Wand it was achievable.
